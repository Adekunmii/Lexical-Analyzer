# Lexical-Analyzer
A Lexical Analyzer for the Simple Ada-Like Language (SADAL) implemented in C++. This analyzer tokenizes source code, identifying keywords, identifiers, constants, operators, and delimiters while handling errors efficiently. It serves as the first phase of a compiler, preparing for parsing and interpretation.
